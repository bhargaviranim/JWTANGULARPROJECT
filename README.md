# UserRegistration Angular project

I have installed the below versions.

node version : v14.15.1

npm -v: 6.14.8

angular Cli : 11.0.7

need to do:

 In a command window (or the Command prompt in VS Code), type `npm install`.

   This creates a node_modules folder and installs all packages from the package.json file into that folder.
   
 In the same command window (or the Command property in VS Code), type `npm start`.

   The application should then compile and launch in your default browser.

Note: kindly change the APP_URL accordingly and make sure that API service is up and running.

const API_URL = "https://localhost:44367/api/";
